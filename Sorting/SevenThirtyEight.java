package Sorting;//Write a program that reads N points in a plane and outputs any group of four
//or more colinear points (i.e., points on the same line). The obvious brute-force
//algorithm requires O(N^4) time. However, there is a better algorithm that makes use
//of sorting and runs in O(N^2 logN) time.


//How It Works in Simple Terms:
//
//    Imagine a set of points on a 2D grid.
//    Pick one point as a reference. We'll call this the "origin" point.
//    Draw a line from the origin to each of the other points and calculate the angle of the line (the slope).
//    Sort the other points by their slopes. If two or more points have the same slope with the origin, they are on the same line.
//    Group collinear points. For any set of points with the same slope, youâ€™ve found collinear points.
//    Repeat this process for each point as the origin until all points are checked.
